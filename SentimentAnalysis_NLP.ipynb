    "First, think about C3PO, Luke Skywalker's robot sidekick in Star Wars. C3P0 is a fantasized version of human-computer interaction in the distant future. However, humans interacting with machines is an every day reality for us. Your home or car smart assistant (Alexa), customer service on websites or phone lines, autocorrect features, etc. are all examples of Natural Language Processing.\n",
