    "First, think about C3PO, Luke Skywalker's robot sidekick in Star Wars. C3P0 is a fantasized version of human-computer interaction in the distant future. However, humans interacting with machines is an every day reality for us. Your home or car smart assistant (Alexa), customer service on websites or phone lines, autocorrect features, etc. are all examples of Natural Language Processing.\n",

    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of deriving meaningful information from human speech. NLP is a branch of computer science, or more specifically a branch of artificial intelligence, concerned with allowing computers the ability to understand human speech either in a written or spoken format. \n",

    "## NLP can be used for many purposes\n",
    "There are many different varieties of natural language processing. These are just a few real world examples of these techniques to give an idea of how this is used today.\n",

    "#### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "This is most of what we will be doing today. Sentiment analysis examines text in order to identify the general \"feeling\" of the text. Take this example...\n",

    "This person is not happy. By analyzing sentiment analysis on customer support chats, tweets, etc. a company can get insights on where their service model is not working. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Topic Modeling\n",
    "Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that is capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups or similar expressions that characterize the documents.  An example...\n",
    "Imagine that you work at a legal firm and someone at a company has embezzled money. You need to figure out who that person is and you are monitoring company emails from the last six months. There are probably thousands of emails and you don't want to waste time reading all of them. In this case, you can have a computer read the text of the emails and identify the ones that are relevant to the topic of money, narrowing down the amount of emails needed to read\n",
