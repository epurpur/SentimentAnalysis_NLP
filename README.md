## Who am I?
* Erich Purpur
* Research Librarian for Science & Engineering

* I'm a librarian here at UVA [Research Data Services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/rds-staff/)

    -I'm a liaison to various engineering departments. Basically, if they need stuff from the library
    I try to make it available for them.  I do quite a bit of teaching both in one off workshops like
    this, ongoing series (PhD+), and for-credit courses. I teach courses releated to python programming and
    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) I also sometimes help people with GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
    projects and programming-related questions. And do various side projects as they arise.

## Natural Language Processing

First, think about C3PO, Luke Skywalker's robot sidekick in Star Wars. C3P0 is a fantasized version of human-computer interaction in the distant future. However, humans interacting with machines is an every day reality for us. Your home or car smart assistant (Alexa), customer service on websites or phone lines, autocorrect features, etc. are all examples of Natural Language Processing.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of deriving meaningful information from human speech. NLP is a branch of computer science, or more specifically a branch of artificial intelligence, concerned with allowing computers the ability to understand human speech either in a written or spoken format.

The rest of the code, links, examples, and explanation for this workshop can be found in the <strong><em>SentimentAnalysis_NLP.ipynb</em></strong> file in this Github Repository.
